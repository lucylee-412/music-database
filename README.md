# Creating a database using PostgreSQL
*2022 Brooklyn College TTP - Assignment #10*

## How to view the database

To access the database on your local machine, please download the `musicdb.psql` file, and run the following command in your terminal with a PATH to the Postgre SQL bin:

`psql -U postgres musicdatabase < musicdb.psql`

Enter your password that was setup during the Postgre SQL installation on prompt.

*Alternatively:*
Please reference the .txt file written up by teammate Zixin for all psql queries made.
